#  Séneca Coach

[![Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-SenecaCoach-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/alejo1630/seneca_sport/tree/main)

**Séneca Coach** is a digital assistant prototype focused on **health and sports training**. The application integrates **Strava data**, **medical documents**, and **user queries** to generate **personalized training plans**, combined with a **sports route planner** that designs routes tailored to the type of exercise and session objectives. Built with **Python**, **Gradio**, **Sports APIs**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📊 **Strava Integration**: Import and automatically organize athlete activities (running, cycling, hiking, swimming, etc.).  
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Digital Assistant**: Generates personalized training plans using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and LLMs.  
- 🗺️ **Route Planner**:
  - Search locations by name.  
  - Calculate distances between points.  
  - Generate loop routes based on distance or duration.  
  - Retrieve elevation profiles.  
  - Display routes on interactive maps.  
  - Export routes in **GPX format** for Strava, Garmin, or other sports apps.  
- 🌐 **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Built with **Gradio**, accessible from any browser.  
- 📂 **Sample Data**: Includes an example GPX file (`ruta_loop_NW.gpx`) generated by the planner.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **Strava_Data.ipynb**  
  Notebook for **fetching athlete data from the Strava API**.  
  Each activity record is stored in datasets according to the sport (`run`, `bike`, `hike`, etc.).  

  **Technologies & Tools**:  
  - Strava API  
  - Python requests  
  - Pandas, NumPy for data handling  

---

- **Route_Planner.ipynb**  
  Notebook that implements the **sports route planner** with the following features:  
  1. Search a place by name  
  2. Calculate distances between points  
  3. Generate circular routes (loop) based on time or distance  
  4. Retrieve elevation data and profiles  
  5. Display routes on interactive maps  
  6. Export routes in **GPX format**  

  **Technologies & Tools**:  
  - OpenStreetMap / Nominatim API (location search)  
  - OSRM API (routing & distance calculation)  
  - Open-Elevation API (elevation profiles)  
  - Folium (interactive maps)  
  - gpxpy (GPX export)  
  - Pandas, NumPy  

---

- **SenecaCoach_Prototype_V2.ipynb**  
  Main prototype of the **application**:  
  - Integrates **medical documents, Strava data, and user queries**  
  - Processes information using **Large Language Models (LLMs - GPT OSS 20B) and RAG**  
  - Generates **personalized training plans**  
  - Links directly with the route planner  
  - Provides a **web interface** built with **Gradio**  

  **Technologies & Tools**:  
  - Gradio (web interface)  
  - LLMs (Language Models)  
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
  - Pandas, NumPy  
  - Python requests  

---

- **ruta_loop_NW.gpx**  
  Example GPX file exported from the route planner.
